# MyMake
I made my own cmake (for educational purposes).
It's project build system for c++.

You should install gcc!

Usage:
1. Open the project folder
2. Create MyMake.mmk file
3. Write project files in MyMake.mmk
4. Put MyMake.exe in project folder (or you can write MyMake.exe to the Path on Windows)
5. Exec the MyMake.exe

Example MyMake.mmk
==================
1 main.cpp
2 :example
==================
:example - name of exit exe (example.exe)
